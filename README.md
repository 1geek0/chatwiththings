# Chat With Things

Imagine chatting with your home, the sensors in your living room, your thermostat, your coffee maker. Or your car, "Hey! When do I have to take you for servicing?". 

This is what we aim to do with Chat With Things, make IoT human. Make it as simple as chatting with the devices, as if they're humans.
